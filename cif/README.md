The cif files corresponding to different alloy systems are saved in different folders.

- In each file, the cif file name is constructed in the form of x_y_z.cif, 
where x represents the type of doping metal,
y represents the type of adsorption intermediate, 
and z represents the adsorption siteï¼š

- x: num 0-5 for Ni, Pt, Ag, Au, In, and Sn (Cu labeld as 0 in pure system)

- y: num 0-10 for h, cooh, ocho, co, coh, cho, cocoh, cocho, o, oh, c
